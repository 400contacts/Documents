# The Role of the Mentor

It is important to note that mentorship have to be based on the needs and abilities of both the mentor and mentee. Therefore, it is hard to say specific things that mentors should do. However, here are some suggestions.

###How to get Started
So, you have been matched with a potential mentee. What now?

Many mentors schedule a call or add the mentee on an IM service like Messenger, Whatsapp, or Slack. When you first reach out, introduce yourself and ask whether the person could get on a call sometime this week and ask for the person's phone number.

In that call, try to answer these questions:

* What are your biggest challenges right now?
* How can I help with this?

The best way forward here is to focus on one specific task to help the mentee with. Here are a list of options (chose one):

* Help mentee make a Swedish CV.
* Help mentee find five employers in his/her industry.
* Help mentee connect to one person in his/her industry.
* Invite mentee to one industry event.
* Invite mentee to lunch or fika.

It is better to do something small than doing nothing at all. 

###Some things to take into consideration

* The payment asylum seekers receive from the state is 700 sek/month. That is a very tight budget. For the first contact, chose an online alternative or maybe pay the person's travel expenses to your office.

* Talk about expectations. A good mentorship starts with people having similar expectations on the relationship. 

* Start small. Make a small commitment to begin with. Many mentors help looking through the mentees CV as an initial help. Oftentimes, CVs are a bit country specific and they also provide lots of things to talk about.
