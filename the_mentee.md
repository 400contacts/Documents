# The Mentee

### What to expect  

It is important to mention that the expectation on the mentor should not be to find you a job. The role of the mentor is to help you with things related to finding a job in Sweden.

So that could be: 

* Helping you with your CV
* Give recommendations where to look for jobs
* Introduce you to the Swedish job market

Make sure that you are clear with your intentions with what you need help with as a mentee and how your mentor can help you.

Last but not least, welcome to Sweden.
