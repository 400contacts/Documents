# The Role of the Mentee

### What to expect  

It is important to mention that the expectation on the mentor should not give you a job but to help you find one. Your mentor is supposed to help you with things that increases your chances of a job.

In order to do so, it is important that you are clear about your challenges at the moment and also specify a single thing that you need help with.

Oftentimes, the first contact with the mentor will be either a phone call or an email. In that conversation, try to answer following question:

* What are your biggest challenges right now?

Based on that question, the mentor and you can have a discussion about what the mentor can do. It is great to have a specified first task that the mentor can help you with. That could be: 

* Help you make a Swedish CV.
* Help you find five employers in your industry.
* Help you connect to one person in your industry.
* Give a recommendation on networking events.

Make sure that you are clear with your intentions with what you need help with as a mentee and how your mentor can help you.

It is best to cooperate on something small and definable in the beginning and then continue of it works for both.
