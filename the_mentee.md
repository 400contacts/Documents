# The Role of the Mentee

### What to expect  

You will be contacted by your mentor on email. Make sure you check your inbox and also your spam folder. It is usually easiest if you make a phone call or send messages through IM in the beginning. Like, Whatsapp, Messenger or SMS.

In the beginning discuss the following question with your mentor?

* What are your biggest challenges right now?

### What your mentor can help with
Based on that question, the mentor and you can have a discussion about what the mentor can do. It is great to have a specified first task that the mentor can help you with. That could be: 

* Help you make a Swedish CV.
* Help you find five employers in your industry.
* Help you connect to one person in your industry.
* Give a recommendation on networking events.

Make sure that you are clear with your intentions with what you need help with as a mentee and how your mentor can help you.

It is best to cooperate on something small and definable in the beginning and then continue of it works for both.
