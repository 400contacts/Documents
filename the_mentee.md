# The Mentee

### What to expect  

It is important to mention that the expectation on the mentor should not be to find you a job. The role of the mentor is to help you with things related to finding a job in Sweden.

So that could be: 

* Helping you with your CV
* Give recommendations where to look for jobs
* Introduce you to the Swedish job market

Make sure that you are clear with your intentions with what you need help with as a mentee and how your mentor can help you.

### While Waiting

Waiting for asylum and finding a job can be a very time consuming process. Also, finding a mentor at 400contacts currently take some time. Here are some things you can do in the meantime:

* Make sure you signup at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/). All recruiters are on LinkedIn searching for talented people like yourself. Make sure you get a profile and fill out all your skills and previous experiences.
