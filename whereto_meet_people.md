# Informal ways to the job

A clear majority of all jobs in [Sweden are never announced formally at job boards and similarly](https://www.gp.se/nyheter/sverige/1.2836239-nyanlanda-star-utan-jobbnatverk?m=print). Instead the jobs are given to employees that have informal relationships with the employer. This is of course a problem for people that do not have the important network that is needed to find a job. So, by all means continue to look for jobs in job boards like [Platsbanken](http://www.ams.se), [Monster](http://www.monster.com), and similar sites. But make sure you also build informal relationships with people in the industry. Here are some ways you can do that:

###Meetup Groups
One very useful site to look at is [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com). Meetup is a site where anyone can invite people to their events. At the moment of writing this, there are 134 278 planned Meetups this week. Here are some examples:

* [STHLM Startups](http://www.meetup.com/STHLM-Tech-Meetup/)
* [Guerilla Office](http://www.meetup.com/Guerilla-Office/)
* [Anything at Foocafe in Malmö](http://www.foocafe.org/events)
* If you don't find one that you like or are related to your interests, why not make your own meetup group around your interest?


###Facebook Groups

In pretty much all Swedish cities there are a group that is called "Jobb i " and then the city name. For instance:

* [Jobb i Göteborg](https://www.facebook.com/groups/292413157527162/?fref=ts)
* [Jobb i Malmö](https://www.facebook.com/groups/jobbimalmo/?fref=ts)
* [Jobb i Uppsala](https://www.facebook.com/groups/366469403506783/?fref=ts)
* [Jobb i Stockholm](https://www.facebook.com/groups/jobbistockholm/?fref=ts)

Also there are usually groups for Startups in bigger cities: 

* [Malmö Startups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/malmostartups/?fref=ts)
* [Stockholm Startups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sthlmstartups/?fref=ts)

And also, make sure you are a member of the [400contacts group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/160223374332272/?fref=ts).

###LinkedIn Groups

Here are some great ones:

* [SIT - Sveriges Internationella Talanger (Swedish International Talents)](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6644475)
* [Telekom Idag (group for telecom sector)](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7402451)

###Freelance Jobs

One thing that is often overlooked is smaller assignments. These are very good for both building connections but also to build a portfolio or resume.

Here are some sites where you can find small assignments or jobs that are remote.

* [Upwork](http://www.upwork.com)
* [Freelancer](http://www.freelancer.com/)
* [RemoteOK](http://www.remoteok.io)

###Volunteering

Volunteering is a great way to meet new people and for doing something meaningful while hunting for jobs. Here you can find volunteering opportunities:

* [Volontärbyrån](https://www.volontarbyran.org/)

Or why not start your own nonprofit about a cause you care about?

###Öppna Dörren
Is a group of initiatives by Axfoundations. Here are some may use:

* Invitationsdepartementet's idea is simple. As a newcomer you will be matched with a local person that you will have dinner with. [See more at their webpage.](http://invitationsdepartementet.eu/)

* Yrkesdörren helps people meet by common professional interests. [Register at their webpage](http://www.yrkesdorren.se).
* Kompis Sverige is a way to meet Swedes. Basically, you will go to an interview with the organization and then be matched with a Swede that has the same interests as you. See more at [Kompis Sverige](http://www.kompissverige.se/).
