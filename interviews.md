##Never lose hope on what you want - Interview with Bukenya Moshen (mentee)

* What did you do when arriving in the camp?

Arriving in a new environment, I started by teaming up. I met Tarek Alhamad and we started talking about how we could leverage our skills in this new environment. We couldn’t just forgo our skills that we have spent years to build up.

I started joining groups on Facebook with Tarek and dowloading some apps for learning Swedish. 

Then, when having found some resources to learn Swedish I started also learning how to code. Because, I wanted to use the time in the asylum camp to learn something new.

* So, why coding?

For two reasons. The first reason was that I had an idea about a project that would help African farmers prosper. The idea was a software solution and I wanted to learn how to code in order to make that solution. The second reason was that I knew coders were very high in demand at the Swedish job market. 

* Tell me more, what do you want to solve with this solution?

A lot of people are giving up on agriculture in Africa. We have great opportunities for growing crops but we don’t have a well functioning market for this produce. So, I thought — if I can bridge the gap between the farmer and the market, then I think I could solve a part of the problem. It is a big problem. Around 40% of the people in Africa are farmers. That number used to be around 70%.

* How was your experience being a farmer in Uganda?

I started growing Ocra when I was 16 years old in order to help my parents with income. The problem I learned the hard way is that it is not only about growing, harvesting and selling. No, the produce also have to live up to the standards that the buyers at the market demand. When arriving at the market with my first harvest of Ocra they started sorting it and actually threw away 70 % of my harvest and I only got paid for 30 %.

So, a lot of the produce are actually not sellable in the market due to a lack of knowledge among the farmers. So, one part of my solution is also to educate farmers on how to grow crops that there is a demand for at the market.

In short, it is both a market for the produce and an educational platform for making sure that farmers grow the crops that are demanded.

* And then you met some mentors from 400contacts, what happened then?

Well, I got in contact with two mentors. One of them, Navid, gave me a textbook in Swedish and also took a look at my CV. My other mentor met me, showed me around Stockholm and posted a picture on his Facebook feed telling people my story. That resulted in three employers offering me internships and I actually had to chose. I decided to chose one company where I had the possibility to both develop my coding skills and use my previous experience from the telecom industry.

* What do you do at your internship?

Basically, I am doing tests with their products which is a GPS tracker. So, I am monitoring and testing these devices in a testing environment. The trackers can be used to track for instance pets and there is a mobile app. For instance, you can put a tracker on a dog and saying that “I want to know when my dog is further away than 100 meters from my house” and there will be a notification on the person’s phone.

* How those this relate to your previous experience?

Well, I have been working with GPS technologies before and these trackers are actually based on that same technology. Previously, I have been working with GPS tracking during the Libya Crisis and also I have done projects at University relating to this type of projects.

* It was really cool to see how you went from arriving in October and then having this internship in the end of November. That went really fast, why do you think it went so fast?

It is important to take care of the time here. You can either be at the camp or you can actually go out and fight for your future. It is not easy because of the location and the resources but if you are determined anything can happen! 

You will never have enough resources and people will never come to you to ask what you want. You have to reach out to your mentor or other people and tell them who you want to be and where you want to be.

* If you would close this off with some recommendations for people just arriving in Sweden, what would you tell people?

What I first should recommend to my fellow people is this — never lose hope. Second, be determined and take what you want. Show that you really want. Irrespective of barriers. Me, I even had transportation problems to an extent where I begged the people driving the bus to help me go to Uppsala because I needed to meet this CEO. 

I didn’t have a bus card. I had 700 sek a month. I walked for hours a day just to go back and forth to the bus. I didn’t afford to buy a bus card. I didn’t tell people that I was walking to meet this CEO. But when I arrived, that feeling. If you are determined on what you want, you can do anything.

You can say, “transfer me to another camp”. The authorities will say, there is no problem here. But, when they see that you are fighting for something and are being determined, then they will change their mind. 

So, being determined, positive and enthusiastic can make anything happen. Never lose hope on what you want.
